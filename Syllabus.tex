% First Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Course Description}

This class is for all of you who have little or no cooking skills and want to learn how to cook delicious meals without setting yourself on fire. The class focuses on using proper cooking techniques and the usage of different ingredients in various cuisines (nothing extremely fancy or complicated). 

\bigskip

\noindent You need to pre-register for this DeCal, starting from Janurary 7th, the beginning of the class adjustment period. This is because we will start instruction on the second week of classes and you wouldn't want to miss the participation credit.

\bigskip 

\noindent \textbf{Warning:} this class in NOT vegan friendly. We will be going through cooking meat. If you are not comfortable with the material, please do not take this class. 

% Second Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Required Materials}


Your brain and your hands. Kitchenware and ingredients will be provided: you do not need to purchase these on your own. You might want to bring take-out boxes for your roommate. \textit{Note}: You also need to pay for the ingredients: information about the material fee will be announced soon. 


% Third Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Course Structure}

\subsection*{Class Structure}

We will meet once for approximately 1.5 hours each week on Tuesday night (class starts on Berkeley-time). For the first 20 minutes, we will have a mini-lecture, going through ingredients and your cooking task for this week. For the next one hour, you will have the hands on cooking practice with your cooking partner. You are more than welcomed to ask the instructors and class assistants any cooking-related questions anytime during the class. 

\subsection*{Attendence}

Attendance count towards 50\% of your final grade. You have to attend at least 10 classes to have the full participation credit based on your attendance (each attendance counts as 5\%). If you attend additional classes, participation credits will serve as your resurrection credits for the midterm and the final. (More details in the grading policy section) 

\subsection*{Midterm and Final Exam}

\textbf{Midterm}: Scheduled on the 7th week of class. Individual assessment. Format would be cooking a dish using provided ingredients (instructions are given). 

\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Final}: Scheduled on the 15th week of class. Group assessment; collaborate with your partner. Format would be creating a dish using provided ingredients. No instructions are given: use your imagination.

\subsection*{Grading Policy}

50\% of the final grade will be based on participation (class attendance). The \textbf{midterm} counts as 20\%: your instructor will evaluate your work based on your ability to follow instructions, using proper cooking techniques and the proper usage of different ingredients. The \textbf{final} counts as 30\%: your instructor will evaluate your group work based on the final product. (20\%) You will also have a say in your final grade by tasting your dish and write a final self-evaluation. (10\%)
Additional attendance in addition to 10 classes required will count as 5\% each. This means you can pass this class only by attending all 11 classes (60\%*) and writing the final self-evaluation (10\%). Yeah! (*We will  award participation credits for everyone during the week of spring break. So we technically only have 11 classes in total, plus the midterm and the final.)
